## Description

Our organization is developing a collaborative platform that enables users to create and contribute to topic-specific graphs, which visualize the relationships among different models and datasets. The graph will provide users new ways to compose AI models & datasets, where experiments can be directly ran on your local hardware or on
cloud resources. This is facilitated by our CLI.

## Contributing to Graphs

After creating your first graph you can commit different models and datasets to it. This opens new paths, which you can select and run experiments on that can be shared publically.
