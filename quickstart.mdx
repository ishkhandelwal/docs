## Create an account

First step is to visit the website and create an account.

<img

/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Sign In.png"
  alt="Sign In"
/>


### Create or load a graph

After creating an account you will be able to either create a new graph or load
a community graph.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/My Projects.png"
  alt="Projects"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/My Projects.png"
  alt="Projects"
/>




### Adding to a graph
Once you have clicked on a graph it will be displayed along with all of its previous components.
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/View Mode.png"
  alt="View Mode"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/View Mode.png"
  alt="View Mode"
/>

Now you will be able to make changes to the graph
by adding new models/datasets. In order to add new models/datasets you will first
need to download a ZIP template and modify it.
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/Custom Dataset Step 1.png"
  alt="Custom Dataset"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Custom Dataset Step 1.png"
  alt="Custom Dataset"
/>

After you have made changes to the template you can upload it.
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/Custom Dataset Step 11.png"
  alt="Custom Dataset"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Custom Dataset Step 11.png"
  alt="Custom Dataset"
/>

Then you will have to fill in basic information about the model/dataset.
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/Custom Dataset Step 4.png"
  alt="Custom Dataset"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Custom Dataset Step 4.png"
  alt="Custom Dataset"
/>

Instead of uploading a model/dataset you can also choose a pre-existing one. If you choose to do so you will be able to search for models and add it to the graph.
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/Enter model search.png"
  alt="model search"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Enter model search.png"
  alt="model search"
/>


Once you have made all the changes you want
you should commit these changes to save it for later.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/Publish Changes.png"
  alt="Publish Changes"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Publish Changes.png"
  alt="Publish Changes"
/>

When publishing changes you will have to write a commit title. Optionally you can also write a description of what the changes were.
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/Publish Changes (1).png"
  alt="Publish Changes"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Publish Changes (1).png"
  alt="Publish Changes"
/>






### Running a path
In order to run a path you can select multiple models and datasets and save the path.
If you do not know what path you want to run but know where you want to start and end the path you can 
select two models/datasets and use our AI tool to find an optimal path. This AI tool uses metrics from previous
experiments to find the best path for you. 


<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/Path Summary.png"
  alt="Path Summary"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Path Summary.png"
  alt="Path Summary"
/>

You can also see previous paths which have been ran and see the metrics in order to choose a path.
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/Path Summary (2).png"
  alt="Path Summary"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/Path Summary (2).png"
  alt="Path Summary"
/>
