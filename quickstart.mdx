## Create an account

First step is to visit the website and create an account
### Create or load a graph

After creating an account you will be able to either create a new graph or load
a community graph.


### Adding to a graph
Once you have clicked on a graph you will be able to make changes to the graph
by adding new or pre-existing models/datasets. Once you have made all the changes you want
you should commit these changes to save it for later.

### Running a path
In order to run a path you can select multiple models and datasets and click run.
If you do not know what path you want to run but know where you want to start and end the path you can 
select two models/datasets and use our AI tool to find an optimal path. This AI tool uses metrics from previous
experiments to find the best path for you.
